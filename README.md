# Jammming

This application was made as part of the full stack engineer course at codecademy.

This first version uses a simulated list of songs.

Its purpose is to search for songs and add them to a playlist which can then be saved in a section containing all the playlists.

Later I plan to implement the spotify web API.

Enjoy!
